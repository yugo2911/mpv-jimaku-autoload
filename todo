archives are not fully working
cache

we have to check somewhere to skip exactly same loaded subs

fix prefered groups
fix archive files, make sure we read deeper than 1 level
confidence feedback is not useful dont show it to users
asyncrous subtitile downloading one the time is retarded

at some point loading subs became way slower? on boot

low priority
- async ui / fetching so we can insta acess ui even if fetch etc is going on

lets rethink how we do cahcing, what order to load the stuff in and what should be loaded async, make sure we index files deeper than 1 level cuz of archives they are at various levels


brokeb subtitle browser jump to current episode broken again......


make it read local files even if anilist and jimaku fail

browse all files(view all files) >, browse all files(Retrieved 1253 total subtitle files)


makes sense to get local subs first if user has them from kitsunekko, if kittsuneko-mirror is used it lags mpv somtimes to ammount of files
